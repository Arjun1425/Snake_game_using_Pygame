    "For e.g., Here we have two files, “mymath.py” and “test.py”\n",
    "\n",
    "-->So, if you run “mymath.py” the output will be “mymath \\n 26”. But if you run “test.py”, you will get “mymath \\n 13”. Because running “test.py” will convert your “__main__ = test”, so the “if” statement will not execute. \n",

    "--> It's a catch-all initialization function. I had the same question when I first started using Pygame. Not every module you use needs to be initialized, but some do. That's probably why you haven't run into any issues with it. You could also run the individual init functions for the modules that need it and skip this one, but it's probably just easier to use this one as a catch-all.\n",
