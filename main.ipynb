    "\n",
    "-->So, if you run “mymath.py” the output will be “mymath \\n 26”. But if you run “test.py”, you will get “mymath \\n 13”. Because running “test.py” will convert your “__main__ = test”, so the “if” statement will not execute. \n",

    "**Why did we put “pygame.init()” in the above “if statement” and what is the point of using “pygame.init()” if the game can run without it?**\n",

    "--> The pygame.init() function initializes the pygame library. It must be called before any other pygame functions are called.\n",
    "--> We used it in the \"main\" file. We do not want to run every time we import the main file. So that is why I used it inside the \"if statement\".\n",
    "--> It's a catch-all initialization function. I had the same question when I first started using Pygame. Not every module you use needs to be initialized, but some do. That's probably why you haven't run into any issues with it. You could also run the individual init functions for the modules that need it and skip this one, but it's probably just easier to use this one as a catch-all.\n",

But you also want to delete the last block you generated you can do that by generating the display again \"surface = pygame.display.set_mode(size = (1000,500))\". And you want to update the display everytime.   \n",
